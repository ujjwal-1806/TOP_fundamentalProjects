    <h2><strong>What is Cheese Fondue?</strong></h2>
    <p>
      Fondue is melted cheese served in a pot over a portable stove. People dip
      bread into the communal pot using long-stemmed forks. The Swiss dish
      gained popularity in the U.S. in the 1960s and remains popular today.

    <p>
      This fondue recipe calls for Gruyère and Swiss cheeses because they're
      creamy, buttery, and melt smoothly. Other good choices include Gouda,
      fontina, and Emmental.
