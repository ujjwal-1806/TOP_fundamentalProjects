    <h2><strong>What is Sausage Balls?</strong></h2>
    <p>
      These sausage balls are a real crowd pleaser, whether you serve them as a
      breakfast or brunch treat, a holiday party appetizer, or a game-day
      nibble. Savory sausage, store-bought biscuit mix, and sharp Cheddar cheese
      team up for a yummy savory flavor that can't be beaten! My family makes
      these every Christmas morning.

    <h2><strong>Ingredients</strong></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground pork sausage, at room temperature</li>
      <li>2 cups biscuit baking mix</li>
      <li>12 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><strong>Directions</strong></h2>

        to 350&deg; F.
      </li>

        <strong>Step 2 </strong><br />Combine room temperature sausage, biscuit
        mix, and shredded Cheddar together in a large bowl; mix with your hands
        until well combined. The mixture may seem dry at first, but keep mixing
        until it comes together evenly.

        balls; transfer to a baking sheet.

        <strong>Step 4 </strong><br />Bake in the preheat oven until golden
        brown and sausage is cooked through, 20 to 25 minutes.
